Things to do to set up the backend locally
- Have node installed
- Run "npm i express dotenv"
- Run "npm i -D typescript @types/express @types/node"
- Run "npm i -D nodemon ts-node"
- Create a .env file in the Backend root directory where you can set your local port for testing
  (use "PORT=[port you want to run on]")
- Run "npm run dev" to run the server (make sure you saved all changes beforehand)
